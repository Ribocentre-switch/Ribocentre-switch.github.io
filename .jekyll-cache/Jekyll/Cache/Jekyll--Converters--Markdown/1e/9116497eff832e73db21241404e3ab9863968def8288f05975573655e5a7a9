<p>This page shows some of the comparisons of the binding pockets from different riboswitches. We sorted out three comparisons, â€˜Purine riboswitches familyâ€™, â€˜SAM riboswitches familyâ€™, and â€˜Guanidine riboswitches familyâ€™ as shown in the following figures

<p class="header_box">Purine riboswitches family</p>
<p>Purine riboswitches family share a similar three-way junction to position highly conserved nucleotides and form a similar ligand-binding site. Members of purine riboswitches family have altered ligand specificity, wherein some classes sense guanine, some classes sense adenine and others sense the nucleoside 2â€™-deoxyguanosine (2â€™-dG). Up to now, four classes of riboswitches have atomic-resolution structural models, which allow us to find out and reveal the significant nucleotides in the recognition of purine moiety as shown in the figure below. Carrying mutations in the conserved locations of the binding pocket, each member of purine riboswitches family alters the affinity for different purine molecules.

<p>Three classes of 2â€™-dG riboswitches, named 2â€™-dG-I, 2â€™-dG-II and 2â€™-dG-III, exist in purine riboswitches family, wherein the first two classes of 2â€™-dG riboswitches have atomic-resolution structural models. Although 2â€™-dG-II has some additional nucleotides insertion in its three-way junction compared with 2â€™-dG-I, both of them use almost the same ligand binding strategy and the extra insertion of 2â€™-dG-II only makes some effect on its affinity with 2â€™-dG.
